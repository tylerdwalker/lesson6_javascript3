### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. The left and right arrow functions create a look that makes the slideshow look as if it is shifting pictures left and right.
2. The createEventListeners function attaches event listeners to the buttons (left, right and show all).
3. The populateFigures function uses the photoOrder array order to add source values to image elements.
